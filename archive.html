            <h3 class="subheader">Introduction</h3>
            <p>Whether for print or for the internet, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_layer" rel="">layer approach</a>
               used in computing has influenced our modern notions of presentation. We treat the
               text—or content to use the popular term—as some sort of platonic ideal floating in
               the cloud, divorced from any mechanisms of production or display and thus able to
               fluidly fit any container we put it into. This is a lie. The people who created that
               content used tools to do it and had certain things in mind when doing so, the people
               who created the infrastructure it rests on had certain things in mind for that
               infrastructure, and you as the viewer are using tools to view or read that
               content.<span class="footnote informational"><sup><a href="#fn1" id="fn1-ref" title="link to footnote 1">1</a></sup></span> This
               does not, of course, even touch upon the contextual environment the development
               staff is in, which influences the decisions made in developing, marketing, and
               advancing the tools.</p>
            <p>In some ways, this impulse on our part is very much akin to how the poststructuralist
               concept of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_the_Author" rel="">"Death of the Author"</a> tends to be popularly viewed as a simple binary of
               control between readers and writers, when really it’s a daisy chain of negotiations
               between the author, the tools they use to inscribe meaning, the tools used to
               disseminate and preserve that inscription, and the tools used ultimately to read and
               understand it. The Author isn’t dead and the Reader doesn’t get to run the asylum.
               We’re all stuck together trying to make sense of things. By not acknowledging the
               contexts and paratext of the things we interact with as coequal with the text in
               creating meaning we abstract them to the point that they become easy to ignore,
               especially digitally. This has implications for interpretation that I've written
               about <a href="http://www.matthewedavis.net/node/115" rel="">elsewhere</a>.</p>
            <p>One of the things that my study of manuscripts and material objects has taught me
               is
               that the content of an item—its text—is always affected by the other materials
               presented alongside it—its paratext. In turn, both of these are not presented in a
               vacuum and so the context in which an item is inscribed and that in which it is
               received needs to be taken into account.</p>
            <p>As an example of this, you just have to take a look at a quick Google image search
               for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=medieval+saint+illumination&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCUQsARqFQoTCLaym4PZ7ccCFYGXgAodiroG1w&amp;biw=1557&amp;bih=1072&amp;dpr=2" rel="">"medieval saint illumination."</a> Every image on the results page comes from
               a manuscript, and is the result of the limitations and affordances of the media used
               to produce it and the medium it was produced upon. In many cases they are meant to
               be associated with <i>vitae</i>, or the lives of particular
               saints, and at times the order that those legends are put into matters. Instead,
               here they are totally removed from any sort of context afforded by the physical
               object and often from any related text through the decisions made when photographing
               them and the decisions Google made associating these images with particular bits of
               metadata in order to optimize how they are discovered online. Because the context
               of
               the image is removed, it can be reinterpreted and reinscribed with fleeting
               associations, as when images from medieval manuscripts are used to make internet
               memes. While I'm hardly against meme-making, what does bother me in this process of
               abstraction is that the original contexts of these items as well as their associated
               paratexts are often obliterated for all practical purposes. Yes, the information
               exists, but locked away in specialist language in the bibliographic descriptions
               contained in library catalogs. It does the people of the past and the objects they
               produced an incredible injustice.</p>
            <p>This page, presented as a series of questions, is intended to help prevent that
               abstraction. It is also intended to remind the reader that although these items are
               currently being viewed digitally, they exist in the physical world as very real
               objects and that both the decisions made and the means by which they are interpreted
               should reflect that.</p>
            <h3 class="subheader">Why did you create the site?</h3>
            <p>This site began as a way to display the transcriptions I did for Lydgate's <i>Testament</i> and <i>Lamentation of Our Lady
                  Maria</i> as they appear in the Great Church of the Holy Trinity, Long
               Melford. As I explain in <a href="http://www.matthewedavis.net/node/14" rel="">the
                  article</a> written on Lydgate and the chapel, the verses at Long Melford are
               doing slightly different work that than those in codices due both to the materials
               they are written upon and the way they are changed to fit the environment they are
               presented in. Due to this article, I became aware of how much Lydgate material
               exists in multiple witnesses and how little is available to students, scholars, and
               the general public. This site exists as the beginning of an attempt to rectify
               that.</p>
            <h3 class="subheader">Why "archive?" Aren't you creating an edition?</h3>
            <p>As explained on the front page my goal with the site as a repository of manuscripts
               and images is to collect the various versions of the manuscripts and other media
               containing the works of Lydgate for students and scholars that may only have access
               to them in print copies that are mediated by an editor or editors. I see this
               attempt to provide everything with either minimal or blatantly transparent editorial
               commentary as different from critical editions, at least when compared with the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=dLAsAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="">the standard edition</a> (E.E.T.S. Extra Series 107 and Original Series 192)
               of Lydgate's poems referenced by scholars and students of the middle ages. There,
               Henry Noble MacCracken makes explicit his goal of the establishment of a Lydgate
               Canon. The manuscripts themselves are meant to serve that goal to the point that
               MacCracken has made silent edits to the text that are not reflected in the manuscript
               practice.</p>
            <p>Referring to the site as an "archive," in this way, is in keeping with the tradition
               of the "archive" as articulated by Jerome
               McGann's <a href="http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/public/jjm2f/rationale.html" rel="">"The Rationale of Hypertext"</a> and put into practice in his
               development of the <a href="http://www.rossettiarchive.org/" rel="">Rosetti
                  Archive</a>, which explicitly refers to itself as a "hypermedia archive"
               rather than just an "archive" full stop. This tradition has carried through to other
               projects either headquartered or originated at the University of Virginia that I
               worked on after receiving my doctorate: the <a href="https://piers.chass.ncsu.edu/" rel="">Piers Plowman Electronic Archive</a>
               and the <a href="http://www.siegeofjerusalem.org/" rel="">Siege of Jerusalem Electronic
                  Archive</a>. Beyond McGann the term is also used for projects centered on
               literature and history such as the <a href="http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/" rel="">Shelley-Godwin Archive</a> or <a href="https://911digitalarchive.org/" rel="">The September 11th Digital Archive</a>. I think it's fair to say that the
               framing McGann introduced has proliferated to the point that the semantic scope of
               the word has shifted for a certain category of scholars and practitioners, for good
               or ill.</p>
            <p>The problem with this shifting scope is that archival specialists have their own
               theoretical models of what, exactly, should be meant by an "archive." As Kate
               Theimer articulated in a 2012 <i>Journal of Digital Humanities</i> article, "<a href="http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-2/archives-in-context-and-as-context-by-kate-theimer/" rel="">Archives in Context and as Context</a>," professional archivists tend to use
               the term "archives" much more narrowly and in keeping with the definition of
               archives articulated by the Society of American Archivists. This has been the focus
               of discussions centering not only on the problems in defining the term, but also in
               the ways that the labor of professionals such as library staff, archivists, and
               project managers can be rendered invisible, resulting in researchers not reading
               extensively in archival theory as well as in their discipline. From the scholarly
               side of the division between library practitioners and academics <a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/english/faculty/profile.html?id=bwhearty" rel="">Bridget Whearty</a> has articulated a model, referred to as the "<a href="https://orb.binghamton.edu/english_fac/3/" rel="">Caswell Test</a>," to
               address this disparity for academics and has co-authored a chapter with Stanford Rare
               Book and Special Collections Digitization Specialist <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/astrid-j-smith" rel="">Astrid Smith</a> in the 2023 edition of <i>Debates in the Digital Humanities</i> to increase awareness of this issue. Perceived power imbalances still make this
               an issue, however. It should also be noted that Theimer acknowledges that the crux
               of the issue is not
               so much the definition of the term "archive" but rather the differences in
               contextual approach between the more formal definition Archival Theory presents and
               the ways that the term has come to be articulated in digital humanities and
               information technology writ large.</p>
            <p>Because the real crux seems to be context-based, I've decided that Trevor Owens' more
               open definition of "archive," which references multiple approaches in their
               differing contexts, is more in keeping with how I want to approach this site.
               Additionally, keeping this more charitable definition avoids what I see as the
               problem with referring to the site as a digital edition: the way that the word
               "edition" implies a level of editorial fiat that abstracts the material object, as
               seen in MacCracken's original 1911/1934 editions of the poems. This cannot be
               avoided, but what can be done is de-centering the editor by making the editorial
               decisions transparent and the collection of materials and the ways they are used
               readily accessible to the user.</p>
            <h3 class="subheader">Why "Minor Works?" Why not "Minor Poems?"</h3>
            <p>There are many reasons why the archive is limited to minor works, split along
               practical and philosophical lines and further between choosing to use the word
               "minor" or not. Practically, the work on the archive must be done around the other
               academic work and teaching schedule of the editor. Transcribing even a small work
               in
               multiple witnesses is a quite time and work-intensive process. Moreover, it requires
               a significant financial outlay to acquire image rights to manuscripts. Doing that
               work for one of Lydgate’s larger poems in multiple witnesses, such as the <i>Siege of Thebes</i> (30 witnesses) the <i>Troy
                  Book</i> (23 witnesses) or the <i>Fall of Princes</i> (60
               witnesses) requires a team and resources of the sort that the <a href="http://piers.iath.virginia.edu" rel=""><i>Piers Plowman
                     Electronic Archive</i></a> enjoys to produce results in a timely
               fashion. Ideally, should circumstances change the multiple witnesses of these larger
               works will be transcribed and the archive may more generally discuss Lydgate <i>in toto</i>. It is for this reason that the full body of
               Lydgate's output, as determined via the <a href="http://www.dimev.net" rel="">digital
                  Index of Middle English Verse</a>, has been included as planned items.</p>
            <p>Another problem is that even if Lydgate is included in the print editions of
               anthologies (as opposed to supplementary or web materials, as an afterthought in
               discussing Chaucer, or omitted entirely) he is generally represented only by
               selections from the <i>Fall of Princes</i>. This is an injustice
               to the to the body of Lydgate's work, which deals extensively with matters of the
               spirit, praise of Christ, the Virgin, and various saints, as well as non-political
               practical advice. Increasing awareness of the depth of subjects Lydgate wrote upon
               might better inform both the larger works anthologized and the history of the
               period. Framing his work as "poems," full stop, also erases the fact that several
               of
               his works likely had a performative aspect, as Claire Sponsler articulated in
               multiple places and which can be seen in the incipits of several of the poems in Cambridge
               Trinity R.3.20 and British Library 29729.</p>
            <p>Finally, the intention of this site is to present multiple witnesses and their
               transcriptions alongside each other, rather than as an online edition where a
               supposedly pure version of the text, close in intent to the author's original (or,
               as I have found with MacCracken, designed for another purpose entirely), is
               constructed from the witnesses available. Instead, multiple minor works in multiple
               witnesses allow readers to better understand the various ways in which Lydgate’s
               verses were put to use during and after his life. Fragments of his poems often
               enjoyed their own circulation and influence as separate works, which can be obscured
               by traditional editorial practice. Additionally, in some cases fifteenth-century
               manuscripts utilized Lydgate's verses alongside those of Chaucer and others to
               create new, composite pieces. Since these pieces are often unique, they are often
               not anthologized or made available to students. By providing the manuscript
               witnesses alongside each other and making the editorial interventions as transparent
               as possible, my goal is that a reader on this site can choose which work or works
               they want to engage with in their study of the poet. Since all the existing
               witnesses will be available for each work, this site then serves not as a
               replacement for the critical edition or anthologized text, but as a necessary
               supplement to them; it shows the ways that both modern and medieval editorial
               procedure can enhance and obscure our understanding of the manuscript in its
               historical context. It also represents the content of the manuscript chosen not as
               a
               static, dead thing, but as part of a network of very real and living ideas in the
               fifteenth century.</p>
            <h3 class="subheader">Why are some of the items password protected?</h3>
            <p>I intend to submit this site for peer review in the near future, and as part of the
               process I want to make sure that the draft transcriptions are protected from
               internet searches until I've heard back one way or the other. Similarly, in some
               cases I have images I've used to make my transcriptions but I am not sure that the
               rights to those images have also conveyed to me. Some medieval manuscript images
               have been placed in the public domain, and more seem to be going that route yearly,
               but some images are still reserved to the holding institution and I do not want to
               run afoul of any legal issues. If you would like access to the transcription for one
               of the password-protected items please let me know, and I'll be happy to provide the
               password to you.</p>
            <h3 class="subheader">What are your editorial principles?</h3>
            <p>The editorial principles for how I transcribe each item are provided by the
               "Editorial Apparatus" menu item for each manuscript. As how each witness is depicted
               on paper or parchment is different, the choices made vary slightly so as to best
               reflect the material object, rather than force the material object to fit an
               objective set of standards. There are, however, some decisions made in terms of
               presentation and comparison of lines that are uniform to the site, and which will
               appear at the top of the apparatus page for each witness.</p>
            <p>If you wish to compare a line against the readings in other witnesses, click on the
               blue dot along the right hand side of the screen. Clicking on the dot again will
               close the box that opens up.</p>
            <p>The structure of the book is currently represented via a reference to the folio
               number in the upper left corner under the site banner. Plans are in place to change
               this to both the folio number and a graphical representation of the quire structure
               using an SVG based vector graphic. The examples where this is working are currently
               behind a password. As such, I have included a screenshot example here, and would be
               happy to provide the username and password for the rough drafts that include the
               graphic should someone want to examine the code.</p>
            <!--INCLUDE SCREEN SHOT GRAPHIC of SVG - PERHAPS CREATE A PAGE TALKING ABOUT IT? -->
            <p>For the site as a digital artifact rather than a series of lightly-edited facsimile
               texts there are some basic design principles I wrote down when beginning this
               project and still attempt to follow:</p>
            <ol>
               <li>"Coding standards—unless rigidly enforced, which the TEI encoding standard is
                  not—can and will never be all things to all people. They are thus best observed
                  in the breach. Follow them when you can, but don't allow the technical standards
                  to obscure the material item and its own unique narrative. Deviate when you have
                  to, but explain to people what you are doing. Provide guideposts—links to the
                  <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/" rel="">standards</a> and a <a href="data_dictionary.html" rel="">data dictionary</a> indicating your
                  ideosyncratic interpretation thereof—whenever possible."</li>
               <li>"Defer to the actual thing you're working from. Undue abstraction is
                  bad."</li>
               <li>"Use the tools that will be most efficient for you. Don't pick a platform or
                  method because it's cool and new technically. Always go for the simplest method
                  you can." 
                  <p>I do this by rendering everything to HTML and javascript rather
                     than try to have some sort of noSQL-based setup. The site as it displays is
                     static except for the model and line comparisons. Both of these functions
                     have to use some dynamic functionality, so they do.</p>
                  <p>I also generate my lists of works via a MySQL database and a PHP script that
                     feeds into the XML.</p>
               </li>
               <li>"Explain what you're doing. You are the expert, yes, but that doesn't mean
                  you're infallible. The more abstract you are, the more you need to explain. You
                  should never see a visualization or text displayed without both the underlying
                  data and an explanation of what exactly it means. Someone who does not have a
                  technical background needs to be able to follow both the scholarly and technical
                  explanations, and it's on you to write in such a manner that they can. Examples
                  are your friend, here."</li>
               <li>"Respect your audience. You're working with multiple groups of people with
                  their own sets of expertise. You are the bridge between them and your work, so
                  explain things in such a way that what came before is not lost in chasing what
                  is to come."</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 class="subheader">How do you go about transcribing an item?</h3>
            <p>This has its <a href="/transcription.html" rel="">own page</a>, as it is a fairly
               involved process. One thing I will note here that I'll elaborate on further at that
               link: I use the <a href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-sourceDoc.html" rel="">Embedded Transcription</a> method from the TEI specification, which the
               exception that I've included two elements from the larger superset of TEI elements
               that it turns out are not part of Embedded Transcription.</p>
            <h3 class="subheader">How do you get the line readings from other witnesses for the
               comparison feature?</h3>
            <p>I utilize a combination of PHP, javascript, and XQuery to grab the line reading
               comparisons. More information about it can be found <a href="/comparison_explanation.html" rel="">here</a>.</p>
            <h3 class="subheader">Why does it take so long to get the comparative line
               readings?</h3>
            <p>As the link in the bullet point above notes, this is due to an issue with the
               installer for the Saxon program.</p>
            <h3 class="subheader">Why do some items have facing images that can be made larger or
               smaller, while others are static?</h3>
            <p>Where it is available, I utilize the <a href="http://iiif.io" rel="">International Image
                  Interoperability Framework</a>, a standard designed to allow interoperable
               comparison, manipulation, annotation, and display of images. IIIF stores information
               about connected images in <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp" rel="">JavaScript Object
                  Notation</a> files, which are a popular way to store and send data across the
               web. By calling to this JSON file, you can then use a frontend (I use a modified
               version of the <a href="http://projectmirador.org" rel="">Mirador</a> viewer) to
               serve the image from any one of a number of IIIF servers directly to your site. This
               is a relatively new technology when compared to other viewers like Djakota and Open
               Seadragon, but it has the benefit of being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software" rel="">Open Source</a>,
               which allows me to alter or modify the way the software works on my site while
               letting others utilize images I have taken without a lot of overhead on their
               part.</p>
            <p>In practice, most of my use of IIIF and Mirador is to collect information about the
               images and display a window that allows a user to expand the page or panel image to
               see details better. There is much more that Mirador and IIIF can do, but for the
               purposes of the site those extra elements are not necessary. If you are interested
               in exploring Mirador as a tool a full-featured demo can be found <a href="http://projectmirador.org/demo/" rel="">here.</a><span class="footnote informational"><sup><a href="#fn3" id="fn3-ref" title="link to footnote 3">3</a></sup></span></p>
            <h3 class="subheader" id="construction">How did you create the model of the Clopton
               Chapel?</h3>
            <p>The model of the chapel was created using a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry" rel="">photogrammetry</a>.
               Multiple pictures were taken at different points in the chapel and any digital noise
               from them was removed via the use of the <a href="http://www.picturecode.com/index.php" rel="">Photo Ninja</a> postproduction
               suite. The pictures were then processed utilizing a piece of software common in
               archeological circles called <a href="http://www.agisoft.com" rel="">PhotoScan</a>.
               Presentation of the model uses the <a href="http://threejs.org" rel="">three.js
                  javascript library</a> to display the model on the web.</p>
            <h3 class="subheader" id="model">Why does the model of the Clopton Chapel not have a
               floor?</h3>
            <p>This is partially intentional, partially an artifact of the stereophotogrammetric
               method, and partially a result of what I privileged in taking pictures. The
               reference images I took were primarily of the Clopton verses, as that is the subject
               of this site, and so areas where there were no verses tended not to have as many
               references to draw from. This resulted in fewer mappings of points between images,
               which in turn resulted in the lower portion of walls tending to be left out of the
               model. While losing some of the lower portion of the walls wasn't intentional, it
               was my intention to leave the floor out of the model. Since one of my philosophical
               concerns regarding the digitization of the material object is that we are
               unintentionally creating virtual facsimiles that serve as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box_theory" rel="">black boxes</a> that
               can easily ignore the materiality of the actual artifact leaving the floor out of
               the chapel model alongside the keyboard-based control schema forces you as the user
               of the site to remain constantly aware that what you are looking at is only a
               representation of the physical thing. It still serves its intended purpose, which
               is
               to show the relationship of the verses within the physical space, but it emphasizes
               that it is not a replacement for that physical space and does not allow you to
               ignore your relationship to the virtual facsimile. Should research funds permit an
               additional trip and the equipment necessary to do so I will rectify the issue with
               the walls, but the floor will remain missing.</p>

                           familiar</a> with how it is structured (and more importantly, what you can

                        background in HTML and Javascript programming or access to people with those
                        backgrounds. If you have neither it will take some work to understand. It's also
                        worth noting that CSS becomes <i>very</i> important once you
                        introduce Mirador into your project. It defaults to a full-page display of the
                        image without any styling, so you can find yourself effectively blocked from
