               <h3 class="subheader" id="description_intro">Introduction</h3>
               <p>From the period between 1464 and 1494 the Church of the Holy Trinity in the
                  Parish of Long Melford, Suffolk underwent an extensive remodeling and
                  expansion, largely under the auspices of a successful wool merchant, John
                  Clopton. He provided funds for, or was the executor or supervisor 
                  of bequests to a number of parish churches in his area, but Long Melford was
                  Clopton’s own parish church. As part of the remodeling process he endowed a
                  permanent chantry north of the high altar intended to serve as means for the
                  salvation of his soul, the souls of his family, and the souls of those he was
                  legally and morally obligated to pray for. As part of the process of building
                  the chantry a number of verses from religious works in both Latin and English
                  were included. Thus, the chapel itself served as a type of <i>compilatio</i> centered on the ideas of penance and salvation.</p>

               <ul>
                  <li>Center Beam
                     <ul>
                        <li>Sections of the invocation to Christ from the Sarum litany between the
                           litany of saints and the <i>te rogamus</i>. The verses
                           are laid out so that those on the southern side of the central beam, facing
                           towards the high altar, contain the set of phrases describing how Christ
                           should protect the speaker while those items that Christ should protect the
                           speaker from appear on the northern side, facing away from the high
                           altar.</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>

                     <ul>
                        <li>Four scrolls painted on each crossbeam on the altar-facing side of the roof,
                           but only once (on the fourth crossbeam from the east wall) on the side
                           facing away from the altar. The text is oriented so as to be read by someone
                           facing the altar, and the phrase "<span class="capital">J</span>h<span class="ex">es</span>u
                           mercy"/"<span class="capital">A</span>nd gramercy" repeats twice.</li>

                     <ul>
                        <li>Verses 29, 30, 27, 56, 57, 58, and 59 of the <i>Testament
                              of John Lydgate</i> on a carved wooden molding.</li>
                        <li>Request for blessing by the saints, now badly damaged, along the base of the
                           now-empty niches that most likely contained statues of the twelve
                           apostles.</li>

                  </li>

                     <ul>
                        <li>Verses 60, 63, 65, 66, 68, and 69 of the <i>Testament of
                              John Lydgate</i> on a carved wooden molding.</li>
                        <li>Verses 8, 4, 14, 17, 18, and 19 of the <i>Quis Dabit Meo
                              Capiti Fontem Lacrimarum</i> on the bressemer.</li>
                        <li>Six <i>Ars Moriendi</i> and <i>Contemptus Mundi</i> verses painted at the very top of the wall
                           underneath the bressemer.</li>
                        <li>Two scrolls above the squint, with "<span class="capital">J</span>h<span class="ex">es</span>u mercy" on the
                           first and "<span class="capital">A</span>nd gramercy" on the second.</li>
                        <li>Two badly damaged scrolls on the right side of the squint, of an
                           indeterminate sequence, opposite a badly deteriorated image of the Virgin or
                           St. Anne, with "<span class="capital">J</span>h<span class="ex">es</span>u mercy" on the first and
                           "<span class="capital">A</span>nd gramercy" on the second. Their positioning suggests that the
                           entire sequence repeated this phrase.</li>
                        <li>Verse 4 of the <i>Ballade at the Reveranace of Our

                        scrollwork wrapped around a typical vinework motif. Each carved panel

                     <p>In keeping with the majority of the source material,
                        the poem is laid out in eight line ballade stanzas, with line fillers
                        where the text is too short for the provided space. However, the panel
                        analogous to <a href="Testament/Clopton/EETS.T.56.html" rel="">Verse
                           56</a> adds a line to the rhyme royal of Lydgate's original
                        verse, shifting the form seen in part II of the <span class="ex">Testament</span> to
                        the eight-line ballade form seen in parts I, III, and V. As the
                        intention of the panels on which the lines were painted is to give the
                        appearance of a single continous scroll, the left and right sides of
                        these panels are at an angle to the orientation of the lines, but the
                        lines themselves are presented with parallel to the ground for ease of
                        reading.</p>

                  <h3>Scribal Hand</h3>
                  <p>Like the other objects in the chapel, the text of the
                     <i>Testament</i> is written by what appears to be
                     a single painter/scribe in Textura Quadrata. There is some Anglicana
                     influence, however; it is most notable in the use of Anglicana “w” but
                     also can be seen in the similarities between “f” and the tall “s” and the
                     form of “r” in the “or” ligature.</p>

                     <h3 class="subheader">Ascenders, descenders, and otiose marks</h3>
                     <p>The scribe consistently splits ascenders and descenders
                        when they are either the full height of the line (as in “b,” “h,” and
                        “l”) or at the midpoint between full height and that of regular letters
                        (as with “t,” “p,” and “q”). Additionally, otiose marks appear to the
                        left or right of “f” and “t” when they are the initial or last letter in
                        a word, at the end of “e” when it completes a word, and at the end of
                        suspension marks.</p>
