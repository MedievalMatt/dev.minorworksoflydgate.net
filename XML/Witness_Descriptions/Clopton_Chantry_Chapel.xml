                        are laid out so that those on the southern side of the central beam, facing

                        should protect the speaker while those items that Christ should protect the

                              the eight-line ballade form seen in parts I, III, and V. As the
                              intention of the panels on which the lines were painted is to give the
                              appearance of a single continous scroll, the left and right sides of
                              these panels are at an angle to the orientation of the lines, but the
                              lines themselves are presented with parallel to the ground for ease of

                           a single painter/scribe in Textura Quadrata. There is some Anglicana
                           influence, however; it is most notable in the use of Anglicana “w” but
                           also can be seen in the similarities between “f” and the tall “s” and the
                           form of “r” in the “or” ligature.</p>

                           (as with “t,” “p,” and “q”). Additionally, otiose marks appear to the
                           left or right of “f” and “t” when they are the initial or last letter in
                           a word, at the end of “e” when it completes a word, and at the end of
                           suspension marks.</p>

               <history>
                  <p>From the period between 1464 and 1494 the Church of the Holy Trinity in the
                     Parish of Long Melford, Suffolk underwent an extensive remodeling and
                     expansion, largely under the auspices of a successful wool merchant, John
                     Clopton. He provided funds for, or was the executor or supervisor 
                     of bequests to a number of parish churches in his area, but Long Melford was
                     Clopton’s own parish church. As part of the remodeling process he endowed a
                     permanent chantry north of the high altar intended to serve as means for the
                     salvation of his soul, the souls of his family, and the souls of those he was
                     legally and morally obligated to pray for. As part of the process of building
                     the chantry a number of verses from religious works in both Latin and English
                     were included. Thus, the chapel itself served as a type of <emph rend="italic"
                        >compilatio</emph> centered on the ideas of penance and salvation.</p>
