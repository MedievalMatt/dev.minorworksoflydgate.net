                     the attribution here, stating that "Stowe struck through the faulty name and
                     and inserted the name of Skelton with his own hand," before going on to note that it
                     is an impossibility that a poem concerning Edward IV was written by Lydgate or
                     Shirley, who both predeceased him (97).</p></msItem>

                                    Manuscripts</ref></emph> claims that this manuscript is collated
                              by Robert S. Kinsman, but there is no indication that the article it
                              sites, <ref target="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3816868">"A
                                 Lamentable of Kyng Edward the IIII,"</ref> has done so. Kinsman's
                              focus is on the poem and so the work is primarily interested in the
                              study of sigla for the poem in question. I can only assume that when
                              CELM refers to the "collation" they are referring to Kinsman's work
                              charting the relationship between the witnesses. The manuscript itself
                              is also not much help, as it has been trimmed such that any reference
                              to quire markers or catchwords are missing save for the verso of folio
                              132, where "callid þ<ex>e</ex> well" appears on the lower right
                              corner. Interestingly, this would be the proper place for the end of a
                              gathering if it were gathered in six, but without any other
                              indications that remains conjectural.</p>
                           <p>There are three blank pages in the volume at 83 verso, 86 verso, and
                              183 verso, but they do not fall at the end of any of the gatherings if
                              we assume the volume is gathered in six. Interestingly, the first and
                              last of these blank pages occur adter the volume's longest works,
                              Lydgate's <emph>Seige of Thebes</emph> and <emph>Reson and
                                 Sensuallyte</emph>, with the outlier being the shorter "To Henry VI

                           Stow's</ref>somewhat inconsistent secretary hand, with the following
                           features:</p>
                        <p>Stow is fairly consistent about differentiating between "u" and "v" when
                           intended, rendering the latter with a raised initial minim that at times
                           can almost appear like an ascender. It is tempting to assume that this is
                           just how the scribe renders "u" in the initial position of a word, but
                           examples like "delyver" and "servaunt" in stanza 9 of Lydgate's
                              <emph>Testament</emph> (the first stanza on <ref
                              target="http://www.minorworksoflydgate.net/Testament/British_Library_Additional_29729/add_29729_180v.html"
                              >180v</ref>) clarify that this is a deliberate choice and that they do
                           see the two letters as separate glyphs.</p>
                        <p>For this reason where "u" is in the initial position in a word ("us" in
                           the <emph>Testament</emph>, for example, in the third stanza on the same page) it has been rendered
                           as "vs." While the scribe consistently makes the initial stroke higher
                           when "v" rather than "u" is meant there is no similar consistent
                           distinction between "u" and "w." An initial "w" can have a raised minim,
                           as can be seen in some places in words like "Withynne" in the final
                           stanza of f.180v or "With" in the first stanza of f. 181r, but it becomes
                           more difficult to ascertain when the letter is rendered within a word,
                           such as with "bowe." Generally, the upward stroke in the final minim of
                           "w" hooks slightly to the left at the top, then runs into the letter
                           following, while in "u" it tends to complete the final minim then begin
                           the upstroke for the next letter. This can be seen clearly in "plukked"
                           in the second stanza of f.180v and in "bowe"
                           throughout.</p>
                        <p>In certain words, such as "our," it is not entirely clear whether the
                           letter intended is "u" or "w" at first glance, partially because the way
                           Stow tends to write "r" in some cases resembles the modern number 3 more than
                           what is to modern eyes a more familar form of the letter. Comparing the
                           formation of the final two glyphs in "our" with the formation of the
                           final two glyphs in "merrour" (line six of the third stanza on f. 181r),
                           "licour" (line one of the first stanza on f. 182r), and "socour" (line
                           five of the second stanza on the same page) suggests at first that the
                           final two glyphs in "our" throughout are actually "wr," particularly in
                           the form it is rendered where "our" appears twice in the second line of
                           the fourth stanza on f. 179v. When compared to "liberte" (line six of the
                           first stanza of f. 181r) and in particular to "recoure" (line five of the
                           same stanza), however, it is clear that the form of the "r" glyph creates
                           the impression of a second bow. This is largely due to stow beginning
                           the strokes for the "r" glyph from the bottom of the second minim of his
                           "u."</p>
