                                <p> The scribe is fairly consistent about differentiating between
                                    "u" and "v" when intended, rendering the latter with a raised
                                    initial minim that at times can almost appear like an ascender.
                                    It is tempting to assume that this is just how the scribe
                                    renders "u" in the initial position of a word, but examples like
                                    "delyver" and "servaunt" in stanza 9 (180v) clarify that this is
                                    a deliberate choice and that they do see the two letters as
                                    separate glyphs.</p>
                                <p>For this reason where "u" is in the initial position in a word
                                    ("us" in this witness) it has been rendered as "vs." While the
                                    scribe consistently makes the initial stroke higher when "v"
                                    rather than "u" is meant there is no similar consistent
                                    distinction between "u" and "w." An initial "w" can have a
                                    raised minim, as can be seen in some places in words like
                                    "whan," or "we," but it becomes more difficult to ascertain when
                                    the letter is rendered within a word, such as with "bowe."
                                    Generally, the upward stroke in the final minim of "w" hooks
                                    slightly to the left at the top, then runs into the letter
                                    following, while in "u" it tends to complete the final minim
                                    then begin the upstroke for the next letter. This can be seen
                                    clearly in "plukked" in stanza ten, line six and in "bowe"
                                    throughout.</p>
                                <p>In certain words, such as "our," it is not entirely clear whether
                                    the letter intended is "u" or "w" at first glance. Comparing the
                                    formation of the final two glyphs in "our" with the formation of
                                    the final two glyphs in "merrour" (stanza fifteen, line six),
                                    "licour" (stanza twenty-one, line one), and "socour" (stanza
                                    twenty-two, line five) suggests that the final two glyphs in
                                    "our" throughout are actually "wr." This carries through to
                                    words like "towr" (stanza eighteen line three) and "creatowr"
                                    (stanza twenty, line four). The latter is especially noticable
                                    when compared to "savyour" and "redemptour" in the same stanza
                                    (lines two and five, respectively). </p>
                                <p>Conversely, "out" appears at first to be a similar combination of
                                    glyphs to "owr," but taking a closer look at the examples at
                                    stanza ten, line five; stanza fourteen, line five; stanza
                                    twenty-five, line two show that what appears to be the hook of
                                    the "w" glyph is actually formed by the crossbar of the
                                    following "t." This same combination also occurs with "but" at
                                    stanza ten, line five and stanza sixteen, line eight.</p>
