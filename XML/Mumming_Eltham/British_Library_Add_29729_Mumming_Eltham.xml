                                    (where the error is corrected by means of letter notes above the
                                    line and so might be missed in copying) or that both manuscripts

                                    above this is similar to an error in Trinity R.3.20, but here
                                    the scribe has inserted the correction to the left of the line.
                                    This correction suggests that the two manuscripts are taken from
                                    a shared exemplar as unthinking copying of either would not
                                    result in the error seen in the other manuscript, yet the same
                                    error at the same two lines appears in both.</note></line>

                                    the final glyph is markedly different from 'you' in the line
                                    above and in line six below. All of this indicates that this is
