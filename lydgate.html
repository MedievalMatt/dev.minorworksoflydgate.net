            <p><i>A brief caveat: this page is by no means meant as a comprehensive
                  biography of Lydgate. It is entirely possible (and others have—see the
                  bibliography at the bottom of this page) to write more than can be comfortably
                  read on a single webpage regarding Lydgate's life and poetic output. Instead,
                  this page serves as a brief orienting overview, intended to give those not
                  well-versed in Lydgate enough of a grounding to understand the transcription and
                  editorial work throughout the site and more importantly to provide readers with
                  an understanding of the major aspects of Lydgate's life as I see them. Since the
                  argument is made throughout the site that all editorial interventions serve as a
                  form of mediation that must be made transparent to the reader, I believe it to
                  be important that readers understand how I as editor perceive the poet. This
                  will serve to help deobfuscate any potential literary black boxes.</i></p>
            <h3 class="subheader">Introduction</h3>
            <p>Perhaps the most important thing to realize about Lydgate is that despite his
               relative obscurity today he was considered the legitimate successor to Chaucer and
               Gower both during his lifetime and for roughly 150 years following. As his
               near-contemporary Osbern Bokenham commented in his <i>Life of St.
                  Anne</i></p>
            <div class="poem">
               <div class="verse">If I hadde cunnyng and eloquens</div>
               <div class="verse">My conceytes craftely to dilate,</div>
               <div class="verse">Als whilom hadde the fyrsh rethoryens</div>
               <div class="verse">Gowere, Chauncere, and now Lytgate (1-4)</div>
            </div>
            <p>As this position in the accepted canon of his time suggests, Lydgate had a
               significant influence over the development of English literature both directly by
               his continuation of the stylistic elements generated or championed by Chaucer and
               indirectly through his sheer output by any numeric measure. He produced, as Derek
               Pearsall notes, "something close to 140,000 lines" of poetry that we can account
               for.<span class="footnote other"><sup><a href="#fn1" id="fn1-ref" title="link to footnote 1">1</a></sup></span> Perhaps more
               imporantly, these 140,000 lines have come down to us in over four hundred extant
               witnesses, with significant works such as the <i>Fall of
                  Princes</i> or <i>Life of Our Lady</i> existing in
               multiple witnesses. As survival rates of medieval manuscripts, and especially
               English medieval manuscripts with a religious connotation, are low when compared to
               how many were likely produced this speaks to both the prodigiousness of Lydgate's
               output and his popularity as an author.</p>
            <p>Also important for my purposes in developing this site is how much of this poetic
               output has not made its way into our thinking about the poet and his culture. Of the
               476 editions that contain one of the 958 individual witnesses of the 189 items by
               Lydgate in the Digital Index of Middle English Verse (DIMEV):</p>
            <ul><!--<item>43% of the works are unavailable in print or online editions.</item>-->
               <li class="bullet_list">67% (645) of the unique witnesses of Lydgate's works are unavailable in print
                  or online editions.</li>
               <li class="bullet_list">93% (445) of Lydgate editions were produced over 50 years ago.</li>
               <li class="bullet_list">61% (287) of Lydgate editions were produced over 100 years ago.<span class="footnote informational"><sup><a href="#fn2" id="fn2-ref" title="link to footnote 2">2</a></sup></span></li>
               <li class="bullet_list">Only 2% (8) of Lydgate editions were produced since the year 2000.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Thus, the editions we are using and teaching our students from make assumptions not
               only about the theoretical framework surrounding medieval studies scholarship (after
               all, even if we ignore the theoretical debates of the last twenty years it still has
               to be acknowledged that a hundred or even fifty years ago notions of the middle ages
               that owed more to nineteeth-century racist and nationalist enterprises than an
               understanding of the culture of the period in its own context still held sway), but
               also about Lydgate
               and the medieval English history writ large. These assumptions often do not hold water
               on further
               inspection. We won't know, however, because as a culture we have internalized the
               negative opinion of Lydgate promulgated by Joseph Ritson in his <i>Bibliographica Poetica</i> and still expressed in conversation, if not in
               print, by most textual scholars working with the English language, including many
               who work in the medieval and early modern periods. Ideally, making more items
               available for scholars to read alongside the editions of the last hundred to hundred
               and fifty years will help us to reassess Lydgate's role in the development of
               late-medieval English culture as well as his role as a poet in the decades following
               his death.<span class="footnote informational"><sup><a href="#fn3" id="fn3-ref" title="link to footnote 3">3</a></sup></span></p>
            <h3 class="subheader">Early Life</h3>
            <p>John Lydgate, the “monk of Bury,” was born around 1370 in the Suffolk town of
               Lidgate, roughly eight miles from the abbey at Bury St. Edmunds where he would
               spend most of his life. His birthdate can be estimated from two references – line
               93
               of the <i>Siege of Thebes</i>, where he states he is ‘nygh fifty
               yere of age,’ and line 191 of book 8 of the <i>Fall of
                  Princes</i>, where he talks about his age being ‘mor than thre score yeeris.’
               Since we can date the two poems to roughly around 1420 and 1439, respectively, this
               yields the birth year of 1370.</p>
            <p>Lydgate was taken into the abbey as a boy but by his own account he was not
               particularly religious. He describes himself in the <i>Testament</i> as</p>
            <div class="poem">
               <div class="verse">Voyd of resovn, youe to wilfulnesse</div>
               <div class="verse">Froward to vertu, of thryfte take litel hede,</div>
               <div class="verse">Loth to lerne, loued no besynesse</div>
               <div class="verse">Saue pley or merth, straunge to spelle or rede</div>
               <div class="verse">Folowyng alle appetytes longyng to childhede</div>
               <div class="verse">Lyghtly turnyng, wylde and selde sad,</div>
               <div class="verse">Wepyng for nowȝt, and anone after glad. (614-620)</div>
            </div>
            <p>This could easily be the result of poetic artiface, however. None of the crimes
               Lydgate mentions in the <i>Testament</i> are particularly
               shocking, and they serve to present the author as a lost lamb in a fairly
               conventional manner. Firmer ground, however, can be found for the moment of
               Lydgate’s conversion, where he claims that, at fifteen, he saw a crucifix in the
               cloister of the abbey with the word “vide” next to it. The change of heart upon
               viewing the crucifix is also a common trope of fifteenth-century confessional
               poetry, but several points of Lydgate’s narrative are not: he mentions that he
               became a novitate at fifteen and took his vows a year later. He attended schooling
               at the monestary while he moved through the minor orders, finally becoming an
               acolyte in 1389. Over the next eight years he would work his way through the ranks,
               becoming a deacon in 1393 and a priest in 1397. </p>
            <p>He attended Gloucester College at Oxford, where he became known to the future Henry
               V: a letter written by the prince sometime between 1406-1408 requests that the abbot
               of Bury allow Lydgate to continue in his studies. It is not known if he completed
               his degree, but this intervention marks the beginning of Lydgate’s personal
               association with the Lancasterian royals. It is one that would continue throughout
               his life.</p>
            <h3 class="subheader">Court Poet</h3>
            <p> From early in his literary career, Lydgate benefited from the patronage of members
               of the Lancastrian court, and it is this aspect of his literary career that receives
               the most attention. As stated above, while a student at Oxford Lydgate apparently
               was to be recalled prematurely from his studies until the future Henry V intervened,
               allowing him to continue. It is unclear if Lydgate finally finished a degree, but
               this relationship with the Lancastrians continued for the rest of his life and much
               of his work was done either at the commission of Lancastrians or in order to support
               the goals of the Lancastrian dynasty. Henry V instigated Lydgate’s work on <i>The Troy Book</i>, which he was already composing in the months
               prior to Henry's ascension and would finally complete in 1420. He also possibly
               commissioned Lydgate's <i>The Life of Our Lady</i>. The new
               king's brother Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, commissioned <i>The
                  Fall of Princes</i>, perhaps Lydgate's most famous work (and certainly the
               most widespread, if the surviving witnesses are any indication!). Finally, Lydgate
               wrote numerous shorter poems to support the rule of the infant Henry VI during his
               long minority, with one of the most significant being "The Lives of Saints Edmund
               and Fremund", a work that was dedicated to Henry VI in order to provide him with an
               example of good rule and presented to him in one of the most elaborate manuscripts
               in existence.</p>
            <p>While on both secular and religious subjects, these poems served as a means to
               promulgate Lancanstrian political policy alongside their moral or entertainment
               value. As stated above, Henry V commissions the <i>Troy
                  Book</i> before he has even taken the throne, with the goal of encouraging the use
               of English over the dialect of French common amongst the nobility of England (think
               Chaucer's mention of the French of "Stratford atte Bowe" in his description of the
               Prioress in his General Prologue). That use of English, in turn, would solidify an
               English national identity and, perhaps as importantly, the Lancanstrian central
               position in that identity. The composition of the <i>Life of Our
                  Lady</i> may also have been encouraged by Henry as part of this program of
               elevating the position of English, as well as to undermine the position of the
               Lollards as the champions of religious verse in the vernacular. He is also reported
               to have written the "Benedic anima mea domino" for the chapel at Windsor and the
               "Eight Verses of St. Bernard" for the newly-ascended Henry’s own use at Mass.</p>
            <h3 class="subheader">Civic Poet</h3>
            <p>Among the aforementioned shorter poems written in support of Henry VI are a number
               of
               performance pieces that would have involved the wider citizenry of fifteenth-century
               London. Thus, Lydgate also worked as a civic poet. His involvement with the larger
               public provided incidental poems on life in the community and pieces commissioned
               by
               such guilds as the goldsmiths, mercers, and armorers, often framed as performance
               pieces. While many of these pieces come to us through texts in manuscript, it is
               known that a number of them, including "Bycorne and Chychevache" and the "Legend of
               St. George" for the Armorers of London, were originally produced for extra-codical
               purposes. Likewise, as I have written about elsewhere the "Testament" was rendered
               in an extracodical context at Holy Trinity, Long Melford in a version that is
               markedly different in the choice of verses displayed than any of the versions in the
               codex, and intended for a lay piety that has as much to do with community cohesion
               as with religious edification.</p>
            <h3 class="subheader">Dramatist</h3>
            <p>Although a writer of both dramatic and poetic works, Lydgate is often most remembered
               for the latter. As Claire Sponsler has pointed out, this is an artifact of the
               association between the poetic form and “literature,” which has significant impacts
               on our understanding of English culture in the middle ages. <span class="footnote other"><sup><a href="#fn4" id="fn4-ref" title="link to footnote 4">4</a></sup></span> It has also worked to the detriment of our
               understanding of medieval drama in general and Lydgate’s works in particular,
               especially because the frame of Lydgate as "poet," full stop, has shaped what works
               of his are anthologized and the development of what is considered to be his
               canonical works.</p>
            <p>Lydgate's dramatic works are primarily in two witnesses, British Library Addit. 29729
               and Cambridge Trinity R.3.20, with a single outlier in Bodleian Ashmole 59. In those
               manuscripts they are primarily called "mummings" or "disguisings," but there are
               several items that have dramatic elements that are performative, but may not be
               "drama" as we think of it today. These include "Henry VI's Triumphal Entry into
               London," "A Pageant of Knowledge,"<span class="footnote other"><sup><a href="#fn5" id="fn5-ref" title="link to footnote 5">5</a></sup></span> and "A Procession of Corpus Christi,"
               which have similarities in structure to several established dramatic works such as
               the York and Chester cycle plays and the Digby <i>Mary
                  Magdalene</i>. For this reason, it is likely worthwhile to reconsider all of
               Lydgate's poetic output as potential performance pieces beyond basic recitation,
               and—as Sponsler suggests—give more consideration to Lydgate as dramatist than is
               currently considered.</p>
            <h3 class="subheader">Connections to Chaucer</h3>
            <p>Lydgate’s connections to Chaucer have been long and well established. Lydgate pays
               explicit homage to Chaucer in such works as <i>The Life of Our
                  Lady</i> and <i>The Siege of Thebes</i>. The latter of
               these works he presents as a continuation of <i>The Canterbury
                  Tales</i>, complete with a frame in which Lydgate sets himself up as a
               pilgrim narrator in the vein of Chaucer’s own pilgrim persona. Chaucer’s influence
               on Lydgate is so thorough that Lydgate incorporates lines and phrases from Chaucer
               into his own verse and even solidifies the place of words coined by Chaucer into
               English by using them again and again. As seen by Bokenham's reference above,
               Lydgate holds the same position for the generation that follows him.</p>
            <h3 class="subheader">The "Monk of Bury"</h3>
            <p>A final sphere in which Lydgate wrote was the religious. The village of his birth
               was
               in the radius of influence for the powerful Bury St. Edmunds Abbey, and it was this
               monastic house that provided him with his basic education as a child and in which
               he
               eventually became a brother. In addition to such lengthy examples as <i>The Life of Our Lady</i> and "The Lives of Saints Edmund and
               Fremund," Lydgate’s corpus includes many shorter devotional poems and saint’s lives.
               A number of these poems even make reference to Bury and to Lydgate’s abbot,
               indicating the clear importance of his brethren to his work and daily life.</p>

                        major edition of the majority of Lydgate's works, Henry Noble MacCraken's
                        <i>The Minor Poems of John Lydgate</i> (EETS OS 107
                        and 192) came out in two volumes, the first of which appeared in 1911 and
                        the second in 1934. This puts them on either side of the 100-year line. It
                        should also be noted that the two EETS volumes were reprinted in 1962 and
                        1961, respectively, but since the editor has not changed I do not believe
                        there were any significant changes made.<a href="#fn2-ref" title="return to&#xA;                                                  text"> ↩ </a></div>

                        to improve the number of witnesses available, treating individual witnesses,
                        complete or partial, as items worthy of study in their own right rather than as
                        adjuncts to a purportedly complete text will help to reforce the ideal of
                        Lydgate as a poet materially connected to his time and culture. Much like today,
                        the fifteenth century has a number of examples of works being adapted, 'remixed'
                        or otherwise altered either through intentional editing or by scribal error. The
                        material aspects of these works, and what those decisions say about the people
                        of the fifteenth century, are obscured through the traditional editorial process
                        even when textual variation is provided by means of footnotes. In essence, each
                        witness is an embodied witness with its own material context, and the site will
                        hopefully help to reinforce that even while remaining aware of its own nature as
                        a virtual adaptation of a material object. <a href="#fn3-ref" title="return to&#xA;                                                  text"> ↩ </a></div>
