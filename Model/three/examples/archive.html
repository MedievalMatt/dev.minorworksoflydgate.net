                used in computing has influenced our modern notions of presentation. We treat the
                text—or content to use the popular term—as some sort of platonic ideal floating in
                the cloud, divorced from any mechanisms of production or display and thus able to
                fluidly fit any container we put it into. This is a lie. The people who created that
                content used tools to do it and had certain things in mind when doing so, the people
                who created the infrastructure it rests on had certain things in mind for that
                infrastructure, and you as the viewer are using tools to view or read that
                    content.<span class="footnote informational"><sup><a href="#fn1" id="fn1-ref" title="link to footnote 1"><font size="-1">1</font></a></sup></span> This does not, of course, even touch
                upon the contextual environment all those people may be in, which influences their
                decisions.</p><p>In some ways, this impulse on our part is very much akin to how the poststructuralist
                concept of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_the_Author">"Death of the Author"</a> tends to be viewed as a simple binary of control
                between readers and writers, when really it’s a daisy chain of negotiations between
                the author, the tools they use to inscribe meaning, the tools used to disseminate
                and preserve that inscription, and the tools used ultimately to read and understand
                it. The Author isn’t dead and the Reader doesn’t get to run the asylum. We’re all
                stuck together trying to make sense of things. By not acknowledging the contexts and
                paratext of the things we interact with, we abstract them to the point that they
                become easy to ignore, especially digitally, with implications for interpretation
                that I've written about <a href="http://www.matthewedavis.net/node/115">elsewhere</a>.</p><p>One of the things that my study of manuscripts and material objects has taught me is
                that the content of an item—its text—is always affected by the other materials
                presented alongside it—its paratext. In turn, both of these are not presented in a
                vacuum and so the context in which an item is inscribed and that in which it is
                received needs to be taken into account.</p><p>As an example of this, you just have to take a look at a quick Google image search
                for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=medieval+saint+illumination&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCUQsARqFQoTCLaym4PZ7ccCFYGXgAodiroG1w&amp;biw=1557&amp;bih=1072&amp;dpr=2">"medieval saint illumination."</a> Every image on the results page comes from
                a manuscript, and is the result of the limitations and affordances of the media used
                to produce it and the medium it was produced upon. In many cases they are meant to
                be associated with <i>vitae</i>, or the lives of particular
                saints, and at times the order that those legends are put into matters. Instead,
                here they are totally removed from any sort of context afforded by the physical
                object and often from any related text through the decisions made when photographing
                them and the decisions Google made associating these images with particular bits of
                metadata in order to optimize how they are discovered online. Because the context of
                the image is removed, it can be reinterpreted and reinscribed with fleeting
                associations, as when images from medieval manuscripts are used to make internet
                memes. While I'm hardly against meme-making, what does bother me in this process of
                abstraction is that the original contexts of these items as well as their associated
                paratexts are often obliterated for all practical purposes. Yes, the information
                exists, but locked away in specialist language in the bibliographic descriptions
                contained in library catalogs. It does the people of the past and the objects they
                produced an incredible injustice.</p><p>This page, presented as a series of questions, is intended to help prevent that
                abstraction. It is also intended to remind the reader that although these items are
                currently being viewed digitally, they exist in the physical world as very real
                objects and that both the decisions made and the means by which they are interpreted
                should reflect that.</p><h3 class="subheader">Why did you create the site?</h3><p>This site began as a way to display the transcriptions I did for Lydgate's <i>Testament</i> and <i>Lamentation of Our Lady
                    Maria</i> as they appear in the Great Church of the Holy Trinity, Long
                Melford. As I explain in <a href="http://www.matthewedavis.net/node/14">the
                    article</a> written on Lydgate and the chapel, the verses at Long Melford are
                doing slightly different work that than those in codices due both to the materials
                they are written upon and the way they are changed to fit the environment they are
                presented in. Due to this article, I became aware of how much Lydgate material
                exists in multiple witnesses and how little is available to students, scholars, and
                the general public. This site exists as the beginning of an attempt to rectify
                that.</p><h3 class="subheader">Why Minor Works?</h3><p>There are many reasons why the archive is limited to minor works, split along
                practical and philosophical lines. Practically, the work on the archive must be done
                around the other academic work and teaching schedule of the editor. Transcribing
                even a small work in multiple witnesses is a quite time and work-intensive process.
                Moreover, it requires a significant financial outlay to acquire image rights to
                manuscripts. Doing that work for one of Lydgate’s larger poems in multiple
                witnesses, such as the <i>Siege of Thebes</i> (30 witnesses) the
                    <i>Troy Book</i> (23 witnesses) or the <i>Fall of Princes</i> (60 witnesses) requires a team and resources of the sort
                that the <a href="http://piers.iath.virginia.edu"><i>Piers
                        Plowman Electronic Archive</i></a> enjoys to produce results in a
                timely fashion. Ideally, should circumstances change the multiple witnesses of these
                larger works will be transcribed and the archive may more generally discuss Lydgate
                    <i>in toto</i>. It is for this reason that the full body of
                Lydgate's output, as determined via the <a href="http://www.dimev.net">digital
                    Index of Middle English Verse</a>, has been included as planned items.</p><p>Another problem is that even if Lydgate is included in the print editions of
                anthologies (as opposed to supplementary or web materials, as an afterthought in
                discussing Chaucer, or omitted entirely) he is represented only by his dramatic
                works or by selections from the <i>Fall of Princes</i>. This is
                an injustice to the to the body of Lydgate's work, which deals extensively with
                matters of the spirit, praise of Christ, the Virgin, and various saints, as well as
                non-political practical advice. Increasing awareness of the depth of subjects
                Lydgate wrote upon might better inform both the larger works anthologized and the
                history of the period.</p><p>Finally, the intention of this site is to present multiple witnesses and their
                transcriptions alongside each other, rather than as an online edition where a
                supposedly pure version of the text, close in intent to the author's original, is
                constructed from the witnesses available. Instead, multiple minor works in multiple
                witnesses allow readers to better understand the various ways in which Lydgate’s
                verses were put to use during and after his life. Fragments of his poems often
                enjoyed their own circulation and influence as separate works, which can be obscured
                by traditional editorial practice. Additionally, in some cases fifteenth-century
                manuscripts utilized Lydgate's verses alongside those of Chaucer and others to
                create new, composite pieces. Since these pieces are often unique, they are often
                not anthologized or made available to students. By providing the manuscript
                witnesses alongside each other and making the editorial interventions as transparent
                as possible, my goal is that a reader on this site can choose which work or works
                they want to engage with in their study of the poet. Since all the existing
                witnesses will be available for each work, this site then serves not as a
                replacement for the critical edition or anthologized text, but as a necessary
                supplement to them; it shows the ways that both modern and medieval editorial
                procedure can enhance and obscure our understanding of the manuscript in its
                historical context. It also represents the content of the manuscript chosen not as a
                static, dead thing, but as part of a network of very real and living ideas in the
                fifteenth century.</p><h3 class="subheader">Why are some of the items password protected?</h3><p>I intend to submit this site for peer review in the near future, and as part of the
                process I want to make sure that the draft transcriptions are protected from
                internet searches until I've heard back one way or the other. Similarly, in some
                cases I have images I've used to make my transcriptions but I am not sure that the
                rights to those images have also conveyed to me. Some medieval manuscript images
                have been placed in the public domain, and more seem to be going that route yearly,
                but some images are still reserved to the holding institution and I do not want to
                run afoul of any legal issues. If you would like access to the transcription for one
                of the password-protected items please let me know, and I'll be happy to provide the
                password to you.</p><h3 class="subheader">What are your editorial principles?</h3><p>The editorial principles for how I transcribe each item are provided by the
                "Editorial Apparatus" menu item for each manuscript. As how each witness is depicted
                on paper or parchment is different, the choices made vary slightly so as to best
                reflect the material object, rather than force the material object to fit an
                objective set of standards. There are, however, some decisions made in terms of
                presentation and comparison of lines that are uniform to the site, and which will
                appear at the top of the apparatus page for each witness.</p><p>If you wish to compare a line against the readings in other witnesses, click on the
                blue dot along the right hand side of the screen. Clicking on the dot again will
                close the box that opens up.</p><p>The structure of the book is currently represented via a reference to the folio
                number in the upper left corner under the site banner. Plans are in place to change
                this to both the folio number and a graphical representation of the quire
                structure.</p><p>For the site as a digital artifact rather than a series of lightly-edited facsimile
                texts, there are some basic design principles I wrote down when beginning this
                project and still attempt to follow:</p><ol><li>"Coding standards—unless rigidly enforced, which the TEI encoding standard is
                    not—can and will never be all things to all people. They are thus best observed
                    in the breach. Follow them when you can, but don't allow the technical standards
                    to obscure the material item and its own unique narrative. Deviate when you have
                    to, but explain to people what you are doing. Provide guideposts—links to the
                        <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/">standards</a> and a <a href="data_dictionary.html">data dictionary</a> indicating your
                    ideosyncratic interpretation thereof—whenever possible."</li><li>"Defer to the actual thing you're working from. Undue abstraction is
                    bad."</li><li>"Use the tools that will be most efficient for you. Don't pick a platform or
                    method because it's cool and new technically. Always go for the simplest method
                    you can." <p>I do this by rendering everything to HTML and javascript rather
                        than try to have some sort of noSQL-based setup. The site as it displays is
                        static except for the model and line comparisons. Both of these functions
                        have to use some dynamic functionality, so they do.</p><p>I also generate my lists of works via a MySQL database and a PHP script that
                        feeds into the XML.</p></li><li>"Explain what you're doing. You are the expert, yes, but that doesn't mean
                    you're infallible. The more abstract you are, the more you need to explain. You
                    should never see a visualization or text displayed without both the underlying
                    data and an explanation of what exactly it means. Someone who does not have a
                    technical background needs to be able to follow both the scholarly and technical
                    explanations, and it's on you to write in such a manner that they can. Examples
                    are your friend, here."</li><li>"Respect your audience. You're working with multiple groups of people with
                    their own sets of expertise. You are the bridge between them and your work, so
                    explain things in such a way that what came before is not lost in chasing what
                    is to come."</li></ol><h3 class="subheader">How do you go about transcribing an item?</h3><p>This has its <a href="transcription.html">own page</a>, as it is a fairly
                involved process. One thing I will note here that I'll elaborate on further at that
                link: I use the <a href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-sourceDoc.html">Embedded Transcription</a> method from the TEI specification, which the
                exception that I've included two elements from the larger superset of TEI elements
                that it turns out are not part of Embedded Transcription.</p><h3 class="subheader">How do you get the line readings from other witnesses for the
                comparison feature?</h3><p>I utilize a combination of PHP, javascript, and XQuery to grab the line reading
                comparisons. More information about it can be found <a href="comparison_explanation.html">here</a>.</p><h3 class="subheader">Why does it take so long to get the comparative line
                readings?</h3><p>As the link in the bullet point above notes, this is due to an issue with the
                installer for the Saxon program.</p><h3 class="subheader">Why do some items have facing images that can be made larger or
                smaller, while others are static?</h3><p>Where it is available, I utilize the <a href="http://iiif.io">International Image
                    Interoperability Framework</a>, a standard designed to allow interoperable
                comparison, manipulation, annotation, and display of images. IIIF stores information
                about connected images in <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp">JavaScript Object
                    Notation</a> files, which are a popular way to store and send data across the
                web. By calling to this JSON file, you can then use a frontend (I use a modified
                version of the <a href="http://projectmirador.org">Mirador</a> viewer) to
                serve the image from any one of a number of IIIF servers directly to your site. This
                is a relatively new technology, but it has the benefit of being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open Source</a>,
                which allows me to alter or modify the way the software works on my site while
                letting others utilize images I have taken without a lot of overhead on their
                part.</p><p>In practice, most of my use of IIIF and Mirador is to collect information about the
                images and display a window that allows a user to expand the page or panel image to
                see details better. There is much more that Mirador and IIIF can do, but for the
                purposes of the site those extra elements are not necessary. If you are interested
                in exploring Mirador as a tool a full-featured demo can be found <a href="http://projectmirador.org/demo/">here.</a><span class="footnote informational"><sup><a href="#fn2" id="fn2-ref" title="link to footnote 2"><font size="-1">2</font></a></sup></span></p><h3 class="subheader">How did you create the model of the Clopton Chapel?</h3><p>The model of the chapel was created using a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry">photogrammetry</a>.
                Multiple pictures were taken at different points in the chapel and any digital noise
                from them was removed via the use of the <a href="http://www.picturecode.com/index.php">Photo Ninja</a> postproduction
                suite. The pictures were then processed utilizing a piece of software common in
                archeological circles called <a href="http://www.agisoft.com">PhotoScan</a>.
                Presentation of the model uses the <a href="http://threejs.org">three.js
                    javascript library</a> to display the model on the web.</p><h3 class="subheader" id="model">Why does the model of the Clopton Chapel not have a
                floor?</h3><p>This is partially intentional, partially an artifact of the stereophotogrammetric
                method, and partially a result what I privileged in taking images. The reference
                pictures I took were primarily of the Clopton verses, as that is the subject of this
                site, and so areas where there were fewer images tended not to have as many
                reference images. This resulted in fewer mappings of points between images, which in turn
                resulted in the lower portion of walls tending to be left out of the model. While
                losing some of the lower portion of the walls wasn't intentional, it was my intention to leave the floor out of the model.
                Since one of my philosophical concerns regarding the digitization of the material
                object is that we are unintentionally creating virtual facsimiles that serve as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box_theory">black boxes</a> that
                can easily ignore the materiality of the actual artifact leaving the floor out of
                the chapel model alongside the keyboard-based control schema forces you as the user
                of the site to remain constantly aware that what you are looking at is only a
                representation of the physical thing. It still serves its intended purpose, which is
                to show the relationship of the verses within the physical space, but it emphasizes
                that it is not a replacement for that physical space and does not allow you to
                ignore your relationship to the virtual facsimile. Should research funds permit an
                additional trip and the equipment necessary to do so I will rectify the issue with
                the walls, but the floor will remain missing.</p></div><div class="notes col-10 col-s-10"><div class="noteHeading" id="paratext"> Notes </div><ol><div class="note" id="paratext"><li id="fn1" class="informational footnote"><div class="noteBody">This is one
                    reason why it bothers me that so many humanists have to use tools built for the

                    for another discipline entirely.<a href="#fn1-ref" title="return to&#xA;                                                  text"> ↩ </a></div></li></div><div class="note" id="paratext"><li id="fn2" class="informational footnote"><div class="noteBody">I would highly recommend playing around with a
                    Mirador installation and <a href="https://projectmirador.org/docs/docs/getting-started.html">becoming
                        familiar</a> with how it is structured (and more importantly, what you can

                    much improved) documentation tends to take for granted that you have a
                    background in HTML and Javascript programming or access to people with those
                    backgrounds. If you have neither it will take some work to understand. It's also
                    worth noting that CSS becomes <i>very</i> important once you
                    introduce Mirador into your project. It defaults to a full-page display of the
                    image without any styling, so you can find yourself effectively blocked from
                    doing any work if you tend to use WYSIWYG editors.<a href="#fn2-ref" title="return to&#xA;                                                  text"> ↩ </a></div></li></div></ol></div><div class="footer col-10 col-s-10"><p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"><img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png"></img></a><br></br>Except where otherwise noted, this work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International
