            <p>One of the things I use to help me think through various issues in my teaching and
               scholarship are visualizations. Generally, these take the form of charts and graphs
               that illustrate aspects of the work, such as my <a href="http://www.sandbox.matthewedavis.net/comparison_chart.html" rel="">layout of
                  the speakers</a> in late medieval place-and-scaffold drama alongside the
               various stages they're performing on, or my <a href="http://www.sandbox.matthewedavis.net/network_simulator.html" rel="">attempt to
                  illustrate</a> the corrosive influence of ideologically-motivated scholarship
               on the transmittal of ideas via networks. In both these cases, the visualization is
               intended to help you see the topic in a way that text may not provide. A mostly
               complete list of the visualizations I've put together and where they can be found
               is
               available on my professional site, as most of them are not Lydgate related and thus
               aren't germane to what this site is intended for.</p>
            <p>The primary visualization that is attached to this project, however, is not a chart
               or graph. Rather, it is my <a href="/Model/three/examples/chantry_chapel.html" rel="">model</a> of the Clopton chantry chapel at Holy Trinity, Long Melford. Since
               the verses by Lydgate in that chapel exist on the walls rather than in a codex it
               becomes necessary to move around the space to see them all, as I've written about
               <a href="http://www.matthewedavis.net/node/14" rel="">elsewhere</a>. In thinking
               about transcribing and displaying the verses online, then, I wanted to be able to
               replicate some of the experience of being inside the chapel space and simultaneously
               viewing and not viewing everything at the same time. The model is my attempt to do
               so, and more about the peculiarities of this particular model and how it was
               constructed can be found <a href="/archive.html#construction" rel="">here</a>.</p>
            <p>It should be noted that you can access the model in two ways through the site. The
               first is via the link in the paragraph above, which will take you to a view of the
               chapel as you just walk in, looking towards the carved hand (I hesitate to say
               manicule, as it's not pointing, but it serves the same function) at the beginning
               of
               the  verses. The second is by clicking on the "view model"
               link in the upper left corner of verses from the chapel (where the icon for the
               gathering, leaf, and page are in those codices I have a collation for). Clicking on
               that link will take you to the model, but looking at the particular verse you
               navigated to the site from. In both cases, however, you can center your view on
               other items in the space (indicated by a note in the upper right of the model) and
               click to go to the transcription and facing image of that item.</p>
            <p>One final note: while I don't think they're particularly useful in terms of
               navigating the items on this site (the "Works" and "Manuscripts" tabs above are more
               useful in that regard) or speaking to specific aspects of the Lydgate corpus I also
               have two visualizations built in part on the work I did theorizing the prototype of
               the Advanced Research Consortium's <a href="https://bigdiva.org/" rel="">BigDIVA</a>
               project. The intent for these was to provide a quick visual reference regarding how
               Lydgate's works connect with their material witnesses, the other works they are
               currently found alongside, and the other authors that are found alongside Lydgate
               in
               his material corpus. This was done in the service of a larger intellectual interest
               I have in the imperfect encoding and transmission of information in material
               objects. As such, they exist primarily as an aid for talks given at the
               International Congress on Medieval Studies at Western Michigan University and the
               International Medieval Congress at the University of Leeds, but may be useful for
               someone thinking about how particular poems relate to each other across multiple
               witnesses. A two-dimensional network visualization tool can be found <a href="/forcedirect.php" rel="">here</a>, while a
               three-dimensional visualization of the same data can be found <a href="/3d_graph/3d_graph.php" rel="">here</a>.
               Both of these items should be considered prototypes—really one-offs for illustrative
               purposes—but they are included in case others find them useful.</p>
