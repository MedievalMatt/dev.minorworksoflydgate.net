            <p>Welcome to a virtual archive of the "minor" works of the fifteenth-century poet, John
               Lydgate.</p>
            <p>The goals of this project are twofold: first, it is an attempt to make some version
               of the manuscripts and other media containing the works of Lydgate that exist in
               less than twenty witnesses more accessible to scholars of the poet, students who may
               have only read them in print editions, and individuals interested in manuscripts as
               artifacts in their own right. To this end, it is intended to provide not a critical
               edition of these poems, but to accurately transcribe and record the variations in
               the witnesses – changes in the language, omissions, and insertions – that are
               obscured sometimes by the traditional editorial process, without privileging one
               witness over another. In this way the project might be considered an archive as
               Trevor Owens <a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2014/02/what-do-you-mean-by-archive-genres-of-usage-for-digital-preservers/" rel="">describes</a> it, as "effectively ... a kind of collection of materials that
               hang together for a very particular reason."</p>
            <p>Second, this project is meant to bridge a gap between the digital world, where
               anything that cannot be concretely categorized is often left by the wayside, and the
               physical object with its rich set of significations. This goal is less about the
               archive as understood by the methodologies of archival theory or concentration on
               and
               analysis of textual content. Instead, it is an attempt at praxis regarding some
               theories about how to best preserve the messy, analogue, digitally liminal aspects
               of the physical object that also encode meaning. To this end, rather than the
               standard TEI document schema, which privileges the content of the text on the page
               and renders secondary presentation, paratext, and physical structure of the material
               object An <a href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/fr/html/PH.html#PH-bov" rel="">alternative TEI schema</a> privileging the manuscript page as an object
               alongside its textual content has been used throughout. Additionally, <a href="/Model/three/examples/chantry_chapel.html" rel="">visualizations</a>, icons,
               and other tools have been or are planned to be used to continually remind the viewer
               of the materiality of these items. In this way, the hope is that the physical object
               is described and displayed virtually in a way that preserves the social,
               interdisciplinary, and historical connections made by the physical object itself
               while also holding to common and accepted metadata standards.</p>
